Brewing Connections: A/B Testing Persuasion Strategies for Latea Bubble Tea & Coffee

This project explores how consumer behavior theories can inform and enhance marketing effectiveness through a real-world A/B testing campaign conducted for Latea Bubble Tea & Coffee. Our team designed and evaluated two distinct Instagram ads—each based on a different persuasion route from the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM):
	•	Ad 1 (Central Route): Emphasized Latea’s product customization and quality, targeting rational, detail-oriented consumers.
	•	Ad 2 (Peripheral Route): Focused on emotional and social appeal, portraying friendship and lifestyle moments around bubble tea consumption.

Project Overview
	•	Course: MGMT 52850 - Consumer Behavior & Marketing
	•	Team: Muskan Aggarwal, Ayush Gupta, Kaushalya Naidu, Navya Kondaveeti, Danish Muhammad Azhar
	•	Business Partner: Latea Bubble Tea & Coffee
	•	Tools Used: Instagram Ads Manager, Meta Analytics
	•	Budget: $100 equally split between the two ads

Objectives
	•	Test which ad strategy drives higher engagement among Latea’s target market (young adults aged 18–34).
	•	Apply key consumer behavior concepts such as ELM, self-image congruence, and reference group influence.
	•	Derive actionable insights to refine Latea’s future digital marketing efforts.

Key Findings
	•	The peripheral route ad (emotion-focused) outperformed the central route ad across all major engagement metrics:
	•	206 post interactions vs. 148
	•	93 likes vs. 80
	•	40 shares vs. 1
	•	81 website visits vs. 63
	•	Lower cost per visit: $0.62 vs. $0.79

These results underscore the value of emotional storytelling, peer influence, and lifestyle branding in reaching Latea’s social media-savvy audience.

Strategic Recommendations
	•	Focus future campaigns on emotionally resonant content.
	•	Use storytelling and social imagery to encourage shares and engagement.
	•	Leverage short-form platforms like Instagram Reels and Stories.
	•	Blend emotional appeal with subtle cues of product quality.
